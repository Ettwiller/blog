[Cappable-seq][Cappable-seq] is a new technology to capture in a specific manner 5' triphostphate RNA. Triphosphate RNA are universally found in nature but only a specific subset of RNA are triphosphorylated; those are primary transcripts prior to any post-transcriptional modifications on the 5'end. 

What makes this technology so appealing is its versatility of applications. We have used this technology to precisely identify transcription start site in [bacteria][Cappable-seq] but that is only one of many possible applications.
