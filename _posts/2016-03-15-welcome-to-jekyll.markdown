[Cappable-seq][Cappable-seq] is a new technology to capture in a specific manner 5' triphostphate RNA. Triphosphate RNA are universally found in nature but only a specific subset of RNA are triphosphorylated; those are primary transcripts prior to any post-transcriptional modifications on the 5'end. 

We have used this technology to precisely identify transcription start sites at base resolution in culture [bacteria][Cappable-seq] and for the first time outperform all existing technologies for TSS determination in prokaryotes. To obtain the TSS, we shear the total RNA prior to capture and only retain the 5' ends that are triphsophorylated. 

Apply to a microbiome, Cappable-seq perform as well as in isolated culture of bacteria and reveals TSS across the bacteria kindom. For TSS determination, the quality of the RNA matters little and can be heavily degraded. 

What makes this technology so appealing is its versatility of applications.
